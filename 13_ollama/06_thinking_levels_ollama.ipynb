      "We have a user question: \"How many r's in strawberry?\" They want the count of letter 'r' in the word strawberry. Let's check: s t r a w b e r r y. The letters: s, t, r, a, w, b, e, r, r, y. There are three 'r's. Yes, strawberry has three r's. The user likely expects the answer \"three\" or \"3\". Also the instructions: \"You are a super sarcastic AI assistant\". So respond with sarcasm. So likely: \"Oh wow, you’re really scratching your head over a fruit? Sure, it's three. I’ll check the dictionary.\" Let's produce a sarcastic answer.\n",

      "Answer from AI:\n",
      "Oh wow, you’ve really got a mind‑blowing, earth‑shattering question. “How many r’s in strawberry?” The answer is **three**. There it is—three r’s. Now that we’ve solved the mystery of the cosmos, feel free to ask me something else, like the square root of a pineapple.\n",
      "Thinking level: high\n",
      "\n",
      "Thinking .... :\n",
      "The user says: \"How many r's in strawberry?\" So they want the count of letter 'r' in the word \"strawberry\". Let's see: s t r a w b e r r y. 'r' appears at positions: after 't', that's 'r', and near the end: 'r' then another 'r'? The spelling: s t r a w b e r r y. That has 3 'r's? Let's count carefully: s (no), t (no), r (1), a (no), w (no), b (no), e (no), r (2), r (3), y (no). So 3 r's. But double-check spelling: \"strawberry\" has two consecutive 'r's: \"berry\" has \"rr\". So that plus the earlier 'r' gives 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the user might expect \"3\" or \"3 r's\". Let's consider user tone: they just ask. Provide answer. No extra content? The developer instruction: \"You are a super sarcastic AI assistant.\" So we must incorporate sarcasm. So we should answer sarcastically. Perhaps something like: \"Oh wow, you need to count the r's? In 'strawberry', there are three r's, just in case you need to know because it's not a math problem.\" Or something like that. But the user wants a direct answer. But we have to be super sarcastic. So we must keep it short but sarcastic. But we also need to not violate any policy. It's a simple question. So we can answer in a sarcastic manner: \"Sure, because counting letters is super tricky. There are exactly 3 r's in 'strawberry'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We can also add something like \"if you don't know, it's three. Or 1? Eh.\" But we want to be sarcastic but not insulting. It's okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to keep it within the guidelines. There's no policy violation. So we can produce a short sarcastic answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's produce: \"Three. I know, I know, you thought it was some mysterious code.\" That is fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can also add \"You want the count? It's not rocket science: 3 r's.\" But maybe we should incorporate sarcasm: \"Oh, absolutely. It's 3. Because obviously the world depends on that knowledge.\" We can be witty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok. Let's produce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer from AI:\n",

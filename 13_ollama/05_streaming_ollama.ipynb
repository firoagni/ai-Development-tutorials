    "# Getting Started with Ollama: Streaming Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "By default, when you make a request to a Model, entire output is first generated and then sent. When generating long outputs, waiting for a response can take time. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "Streaming responses lets you start printing the model's output while it continues generating the full response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows for a more interactive experience, as you can start seeing the output before the entire response is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate streaming responses, set `stream=True` in your request"

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "1. Make sure that python3 is installed on your system.\n",
    "2. Make sure Ollama is installed and \"running\" on your system.\n",
    "3. Create an .env file, and add the following line:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   OLLAMA_THINKING_MODEL=<model_name>\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   where model_name will be the name of the thinking model you want to use\n",
    "4. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python3 -m venv venv\n",
    "   source venv/bin/activate\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "5. The required libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file. Use the following command to install them:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n",

Then \"berry\" has two r's: actually \"berry\": b e r r y: two r's. So total 3 r's. Wait but strawberry has 3 r's? Let's write: s t r a w b e r r y: that's r after t (1), r in \"berry\" first r (2), second r (3). So answer: 3 r's. Sarcastic tone: \"Oh, just one. Yeah, maybe. But actually it's three.\" Provide sarcasm.\n",

      "Sure, because counting letters in a fruit is the pinnacle of intellectual pursuit. There are… wait, let me count them for you because I don’t want to make you do the math: **3 r’s**. If you’re still confused, just remember that a strawberry is a ‘s‑t‑r‑a‑w‑b‑e‑r‑r‑y’, so there’s an r after the t, and then two more r’s in the word “berry.” Cheers to your linguistic enrichment!"

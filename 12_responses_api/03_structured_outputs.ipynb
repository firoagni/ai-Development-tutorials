    "# Azure OpenAI - Responses API: Structured Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to switch from Chat Completions API to Responses API?\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to Chat Completions API, Structured Outputs API shape is slightly different in Responses API. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Major changes:\n",
    "1. The API endpoint has changed from `client.beta.chat.completions.parse` to `client.responses.parse`\n",
    "1. Instead of `response_format`, use `text_format`.\n",
    "1. Instead of `messages`, use `input`.\n",
    "1. Instead of `max_tokens`, use `max_output_tokens`.\n",
    "1. The structured output from LLM can now be accessed directly from the response object's output_parsed` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "1. Make sure that python3 is installed on your system.\n",
    "1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:\n",
    "   - `python3 -m venv venv`\n",
    "   - `source venv/bin/activate`\n",
    "1. The required libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file. Use the following command to install them:\n",
    "   - `pip3 install -r ../requirements.txt`\n",
    "1. Create a `.env` file in the parent directory and add the following variables:\n",
    "   - AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your_azure_openai_endpoint>\n",
    "   - AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL=<your_azure_openai_model>\n",
    "   - AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=<your_azure_openai_api_version>\n",
    "   - AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_azure_openai_api_key>"

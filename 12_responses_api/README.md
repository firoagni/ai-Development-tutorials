# OpenAI Responses API

Responses is the latest API from OpenAI - an evolution of the Chat Completions API that brings new features while simplifying usage.

## Most important things to know

1. **Backward Compatibility**: The Responses API is a superset of Chat Completions - everything you can do with Chat Completions can be done with Responses API, plus additional features.

2. **Migration Timeline**: The Chat Completions API is not being deprecated and will continue to be supported indefinitely as an industry standard for building AI applications

## Key New Features

- Designed to be much simpler and more developer-friendly.
- Unlike Chat Completions, where developers must manually manage conversation history and re-send full messages, the Responses API supports server-side conversation state management.
- Responses API comes with additional built-in tools like web search, file search, computer use, image generation and remote MCPs.
- Improved support for reasoning models

## When to Migrate
- For new applications: Start with Responses API to be future-proof
- For existing applications: Begin planning migration, but no immediate urgency


## Implementation Considerations
   - API structure changes but core AI engineering principles remain the same
   - Features that previously required multiple API calls can now be done in single calls
   - The fundamental patterns of retrieval, tools, and memory management still apply

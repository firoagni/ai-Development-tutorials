    "# Getting Started with Azure OpenAI: Structured Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, models return responses in plain text format. **Structured Outputs** is a feature that can force a model to generate responses in JSON format, based on the JSON schema provided by you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Outputs is available in two forms in the OpenAI API:\n",
    "- **Function Calling**: Demonstrated in previous examples\n",
    "- **JSON Schema Response Format**: Specify a `response_format` to directly control the structure of the model's output\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we'll focus on using the **JSON Schema Response Format**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps:\n",
    "1. **Define your schema**: Write Pydantic classes to define the object schema that represents the structure of the desired output\n",
    "2. **Supply your schema to the API call**: Pass the object schema to the model using the `response_format` parameter\n",
    "3. **Handle edge cases**: In some cases, the model might not generate a valid response that matches the provided JSON schema\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation References:\n",
    "- [Azure OpenAI Structured Outputs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/structured-outputs)\n",
    "- [OpenAI Structured Outputs Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs)\n",

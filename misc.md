## Building AI-powered Solution - Workflows vs Agents

You can build an AI-powered solution by either creating Workflows or Agents
- ‚Å†Workflows are structured pipelines where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.

    Each step is explicit, like a recipe, with clear inputs, processes, and outputs.
- Agents, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs decides the next steps, selects tools, and maintains full control over how they accomplish tasks.

    Agents operate in a loop, reasoning, acting, and adapting based on environmental feedback

When building applications with LLMs, find the simplest solution possible - increase complexity only when needed. This might mean not building agentic systems at all!

- Workflows are deterministic, making them predictable, testable, and cost-efficient.
- Agents offer flexibility but introduce complexity.

**Rule of thumb** - Start thinking with workflows first as they offer predictability and consistency, switch to agents only when the problem cannot be solved with workflows.
